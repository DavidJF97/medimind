                            <h3>Yoga improves strength, balance and flexibility.</h3>
                            <p>
                                Slow movements and deep breathing increase blood flow and warm up muscles, while holding a pose can build strength.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Yoga helps with back pain relief.</h3>
                            <p>
                                Yoga is as good as basic stretching for easing pain and improving mobility in people with lower back pain. 
                                The American College of Physicians recommends yoga as a first-line treatment for chronic low back pain.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Yoga can ease arthritis symptoms.</h3>
                            <p>
                                Gentle yoga has been shown to ease some of the discomfort of tender, swollen joints for people with arthritis, according to a Johns Hopkins review of 11 recent studies.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Yoga benefits heart health.</h3>
                            <p>
                                Regular yoga practice may reduce levels of stress and body-wide inflammation, contributing to healthier hearts. 
                                Several of the factors contributing to heart disease, including high blood pressure and excess weight, can also be addressed through yoga.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Yoga relaxes you, to help you sleep better.</h3>
                            <p>
                                Research shows that a consistent bedtime yoga routine can help you get in the right mindset and prepare your body to fall asleep and stay asleep.

                <h2>Meditation</h2>
                <p>
                Meditation can be defined as a set of techniques that are intended to encourage a heightened state of awareness and focused attention. 
                Meditation is also a consciousness-changing technique that has been shown to have a wide number of long-lasting benefits on psychological well-being when utilised routinely.

                            <h2>Why practice meditation? What are the benefits?</h2>
                            <h3>Meditation reduces stress</h3>
                            <p>
                                Stress reduction is one of the most common reasons people try meditation.
                                One review concluded that meditation lives up to its reputation for stress reduction.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In an 8-week study, a meditation style called “mindfulness meditation” reduced the inflammation response caused by stress.
                                Furthermore, research has shown that meditation may also improve symptoms of stress-related conditions, including irritable bowel syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder, and fibromyalgia.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Meditation helps control anxiety</h3>   
                            <p>
                                Meditation can reduce stress levels, which translates to less anxiety.
                                A meta-analysis including nearly 1,300 adults found that meditation may decrease anxiety.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Notably, this effect was strongest in those with the highest levels of anxiety.
                                Also, one study found that 8 weeks of mindfulness meditation helped reduce anxiety symptoms in people with generalized anxiety disorder, along with increasing positive self-statements and improving stress reactivity and coping.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Meditation promotes emotional health</h3>
                            <p>
                                Some forms of meditation can lead to improved self-image and a more positive outlook on life.
                                For example, one review of treatments given to more than 3,500 adults found that mindfulness meditation improved symptoms of depression.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Similarly, a review of 18 studies showed that people receiving meditation therapies experienced reduced symptoms of depression, compared with those in a control group.
                                Another study found that people who completed a meditation exercise experienced fewer negative thoughts in response to viewing negative images, compared with those in a control group.

                <h2>Mindfulness</h2>
                <p>
                    Mindfulness is the basic human ability to be fully present, aware of where we are and what we're doing, and not overly reactive or overwhelmed by what’s going on around us.
                    Mindfulness is a quality that every human being already possesses, it's not something you have to conjure up, you just have to learn how to access it.

                            <h3>Increased Emotional Regulation</h3>
                            <p>
                                A potential benefit of mindfulness is that the practice may help you identify and manage your feelings. 
                                Emotional regulation refers to your ability to exert control over your own emotions. 
                                This means being able to both enhance or reign in emotions depending on the situation and need.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Reduced Anxiety and Stress</h3>
                            <p>
                                Chronic stress is a significant problem for many adults that can contribute to a variety of health problems, including an increased risk of depression and anxiety. 
                                According to the American Psychological Association, mindfulness can be helpful for soothing feelings of anxiety and stress.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Better Memory</h3>
                            <p>
                                Mindfulness may also have potential as a way to boost your memory.
                                In one 2019 study, participants either received four weeks of mindfulness training or took a creative writing course. 
                                Memory tests indicated that those who had been trained in mindfulness practices showed the greatest reductions in proactive interference, which resulted in improvements in their short-term memory.

                            <h3>Stronger Relationships</h3>
                            <p>
                                There is also emerging evidence that practicing mindfulness may have a positive impact on your interpersonal relationships. 
                                A 2018 study found that people who were more mindful also tended to be more accepting of their partner's flaws and imperfections.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                People who are more accepting of their partners are also more satisfied with their relationships. 
                                Instead of focusing on their partner's flaws and trying to change them, mindfulness makes it easier to accept that their partner is not always perfect.
